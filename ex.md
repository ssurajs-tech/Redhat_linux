# Match Text in Command Output with Regular Expressions

This guide shows how to search for text in system logs and command outputs using regular expressions, making it easier to find important information.

---

## Outcomes

- Efficiently search for text in log files and configuration files using regular expressions.

---

## Preparation

Before starting, ensure your environment is ready.  
On the **workstation** as the `student` user, run:

```sh
lab start console-regex
```

This command sets up all required resources for the exercise.

---

## Instructions

### 1. Log in to the Server

Connect to `servera` as the `student` user, then switch to the `root` user:

```sh
ssh student@servera
sudo -i
# Password: student
```

---

### 2. Find GID and UID for Postfix and Postdrop

Use `rpm -q --scripts` to see the scripts used during the installation of the `postfix` package.  
Filter for lines mentioning `user` or `group`:

```sh
rpm -q --scripts postfix | grep -e 'user' -e 'group'
```

**Explanation:**  
- `rpm -q --scripts postfix` shows the scripts run when installing or removing the package.
- `grep -e 'user' -e 'group'` filters lines containing "user" or "group", helping you find where users and groups are created.

---

### 3. Display the First Two Postfix Messages in `/var/log/maillog`

To see the first two log entries related to postfix:

```sh
grep 'postfix' /var/log/maillog | head -n 2
```

**Explanation:**  
- `grep 'postfix' /var/log/maillog` finds all lines mentioning "postfix".
- `head -n 2` shows only the first two matches.

---

### 4. Find the Postfix Queue Directory

Search the Postfix configuration file for queue-related settings:

```sh
grep -i 'queue' /etc/postfix/main.cf
```

**Explanation:**  
- `-i` makes the search case-insensitive.
- This helps you find the queue directory and related parameters.

---

### 5. Confirm Postfix Writes to `/var/log/messages`

Open the log file and search for "Postfix":

```sh
less /var/log/messages
```

Inside `less`, type `/Postfix` to search for the term.  
- Press `n` to go to the next match.
- Press `q` to quit.

**Explanation:**  
- This confirms that Postfix logs messages to `/var/log/messages`.

---

### 6. Confirm Postfix is Running

Check for running Postfix processes:

```sh
ps aux | grep postfix
```

**Explanation:**  
- `ps aux` lists all running processes.
- `grep postfix` filters for lines containing "postfix".

---

### 7. Confirm qmgr, cleanup, and pickup Queues

Check the Postfix master configuration for queue processes:

```sh
grep -e qmgr -e pickup -e cleanup /etc/postfix/master.cf
```

**Explanation:**  
- This command checks if the `qmgr`, `pickup`, and `cleanup` services are configured in Postfix.

---

### 8. Return to the Workstation

Exit from the server and return to your workstation:

```sh
exit
exit
```

---

## Finish

On the workstation, complete the exercise:

```sh
lab finish console-regex
```

**Explanation:**  
- This command cleans up resources and ensures your environment is ready for future exercises.

---

## Summary

You have learned how to:
- Use `grep` and regular expressions to search logs and configuration files.
- Identify important Postfix configuration and log entries.
- Confirm service status and configuration using command-line tools.
